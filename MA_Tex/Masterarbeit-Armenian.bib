abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This article approaches from a new angle the question of the extent to which predictable information is stored in the lexicon. By examining the ways in which morphological phenomena can be sensitive to prosodic structure, I argue that some - but not all - predictable information is stored in lexical entries. Detailed analysis of a fragment of the Armenian phonological system, focusing on the behavior of consonants at morpheme edges, supports a more abstract view of phonological representations (containing syllables, appendices, and unparsed segments) than can be inferred from phonetic facts alone, contra Ohala and Kawasaki-Fukumori (1997), Steriade (1999), Scheer (2002), and others. The Armenian facts furthermore indicate that attempts to abandon underlying representations (Flemming 1995, Burzio 1996) are misguided and that we must also retreat from the excessively abstract underspecification approaches advocated by most phonologists. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

@article{Sander2005,
abstract = {Multiple levels of processing are thought to be involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant events, with some processes being engaged relatively independently of attention, whereas other processes may depend on attention and current task goals or context. We conducted an event-related fMRI experiment to examine how processing angry voice prosody, an affectively and socially salient signal, is modulated by voluntary attention. To manipulate attention orthogonally to emotional prosody, we used a dichotic listening paradigm in which meaningless utterances, pronounced with either angry or neutral prosody, were presented simultaneously to both ears on each trial. In two successive blocks, participants selectively attended to either the left or right ear and performed a gender-decision on the voice heard on the target side. Our results revealed a functional dissociation between different brain areas. Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was heard from a to-be-attended or to-be-ignored voice, the orbitofrontal cortex and the cuneus in medial occipital cortex showed greater activation to the same emotional stimuli when the angry voice was to-be-attended rather than to-be-ignored. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed a strong correlation between orbitofrontal regions and sensitivity on a behavioral inhibition scale measuring proneness to anxiety reactions. Our results underscore the importance of emotion and attention interactions in social cognition by demonstrating that multiple levels of processing are involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant cues in voices, and by showing a modulation of some emotional responses by both the current task-demands and individual differences. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Traunmuller1994,
abstract = {Published data on the frequency of the voice fundamental (F0) in speech show its range of variation, often expressed in terms of two standard deviations (SD) of the F0-distribution, to be approximately the same for men and women if expressed in semitones, but the observed SD varies substantially between different investigations. Most of the differences can be attributed to the following factors: SD is increased in tone languages and it varies with the type of discourse. The more ‘lively' the type of discourse, the larger it is. The dependence of SD on the type of discourse tends to be mom pronounced in the speech of women than of men. Based on an analysis of various production data A is shown that speakers normally achieve an increased SD by increasing the excursions of F0 from a ‘base-value' that lies about 1.5 SD below their mean F0. This is relevant to applications in speech technology as well as to general theories of speech communication such as the ‘modulation theory' in which the base-value of F0 is seen as a carrier of frequency.},

@article{Hovhannisyan2015,
abstract = {Prosodic Features of Spoken Utterances in Armenian. – Certain metrical patterns attested in native Armenian spoken utterances are usually labelled as unacceptable in adult standardized speech (ira cf. ir ‘his/her', incha? cf. inch? ‘what?', mezi cf. mez ‘us', etc.) or strange/unaccountable in child language (“Harik senak mət tse” (Tigran 1.2) cf. “Hairiki seniak ʧem mətel”-'I haven't entered daddy's study'). Unfortunately, authentic spoken utterances have not been seriously addressed in Armenian linguistic studies, though as compared to the so- called ‘literary' (standardized and to some extent artificial) speech, naturally spoken utterances often reveal crucial information about the structure of a language or language in general. The present analysis accounts for certain monosyllabic structures surfacing consistently as bisyllabic (C)V.C□′ by adding an obligatory nucleus constituent to the final onset - mez→me.zi ‘us', ir→i.ra ‘his/her'. This reality suggests that the occurrence of augmented units in surface representations is directly dependent on cer- tain phonological processes, those that secure Foot Binarity in prosodic structures to satisfy UG or/and language specific well-formedness conditions for metrical representa- tions.},

@phdthesis{Vaux1994,
abstract = {This thesis develops an analysis of the phonological system of modern standard Armenian within Rules and Representations Theory, a model of phonology which assumes full specification in underlying representations and rule-driven derivations. I focus on the impact of Armenian data on current theories of underspecification, feature geometry, consonant-vowel interactions, syllabification, vowel harmony, and constraints and repairs. Some of the more interesting theoretical claims of this thesis are that languages can assign consonants to syllable nuclei at an intermediate point in derivations, even though these consonants always surface as syllable margins; uvulars, epiglottals, and pharyngeals are in a relationship analogous to that between high, mid, and low vowels, and the Lower Vocal Tract node dominating these segments occupies a position directly parallel to the traditional Place node; contour segments show only edge effects and no anti-edge effects; voiceless but not voiced fricatives are (+spread glottis); the common phenomenon of nasal voicing is controlled by a marking statement * (+nasal, +spread glottis), contrary to the traditional view involving the configuration * (+nasal, {\$}-{\$}continuant); and voiced aspirates are best viewed as simple segments characterized by the features ({\$}-{\$}stiff vocal folds, +spread glottis). The thesis is divided into five chapters: the first sets out the theoretical assumptions on which I base my work; chapter two presents a basic overview of Armenian phonology focusing on stress assignment, syllabification, and vowel harmony; chapter three develops an account of syllabification and epenthesis in the literary dialects; chapter four considers evidence bearing on the feature geometric component of universal grammar; and chapter five examines the phonological behavior of laryngeal features in the Armenian dialect of New Julfa and presents an analysis of the consonant shifts which occurred in the modern Armenian and Indo-Aryan dialects.},
