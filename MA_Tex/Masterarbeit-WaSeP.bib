abstract = {In this response to commentaries, we revisit the two main arguments of our target article. Based on data drawn from a variety of research areas - vocal behavior in nonhuman primates, speech physiology and pathology, neurobiology of basal ganglia functions, motor skill learning, paleoanthropological concepts - the target article, first, suggests a two-stage model of the evolution of the crucial motor prerequisites of spoken language within the hominin lineage: (1) monosynaptic refinement of the projections of motor cortex to brainstem nuclei steering laryngeal muscles, and (2) subsequent vocal-laryngeal elaboration of cortico-basal ganglia circuits, driven by human-specific FOXP2 mutations. Second, as concerns the ontogenetic development of verbal communication, age-dependent interactions between the basal ganglia and their cortical targets are assumed to contribute to the time course of the acquisition of articulate speech. Whereas such a phylogenetic reorganization of cortico-striatal circuits must be considered a necessary prerequisite for ontogenetic speech acquisition, the 30 commentaries - addressing the whole range of data sources referred to - point at several further aspects of acoustic communication which have to be added to or integrated with the presented model. For example, the relationships between vocal tract movement sequencing - the focus of the target article - and rhythmical structures of movement organization, the connections between speech motor control and the central-auditory and central-visual systems, the impact of social factors upon the development of vocal behavior (in nonhuman primates and in our species), and the interactions of ontogenetic speech acquisition - based upon FOXP2-driven structural changes at the level of the basal ganglia - with preceding subvocal stages of acoustic communication as well as higher-order (cognitive) dimensions of phonological development. Most importantly, thus, several promising future research directions unfold from these contributions - accessible to clinical studies and functional imaging in our species as well as experimental investigations in nonhuman primates.},

abstract = {Previous studies on prosody perception showed inconsistent results concerning the functional role of the hemispheres. One argument for this might be the stimulus material was not sufficiently evaluated. Thus, we developed a corpus which fulfils this requirement. The "Magdeburger Prosodie-Korpus" which was specifically developed for the requirements of fMRI and MEG studies contains two parts. The first part consists of German nouns, the second part of pseudo-words, with both parts being spoken with different emotional prosodies by an actor and an actress. All nouns were evaluated with respect to the emotional connotation (positive, negative, neutral) of their semantic content. The results showed that only a small number of nouns received the same emotional assessment from the participants. The different emotional prosodies of the pseudo-words were assessed by a group of expert (phonetician) and non-expert listeners who are all native German speakers. All emotional prosodies (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and neutral), spoken by the man and the woman, were identified by more than 70{\%} of all listeners, except for sadness of the man. There were no significant differences with respect to the gender of the listeners or the speakers. The acoustic analysis showed differences in specific acoustic features of the various emotional prosodies, for example, pitch contour, duration, stress, and intensity. The results were added to the database of the "Magdeburger Prosodie-Korpus".},
