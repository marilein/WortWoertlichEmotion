abstract = {In early 2012 the online perception experiment software Percy was deployed on a production server at our lab. Since then, 38 experiments have been made publicly available, with a total of 3078 experiment sessions. In the course of time, the software has been continuously updated and extended to adapt to changing user requirements. Web-based editors for the structure and layout of the experiments have been developed. This paper describes the system architecture, presents usage statistics, discusses typical characteristics of online experiments, and gives an outlook on ongoing work. webapp.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/WebExperiment lists all currently active experiments.},

@article{Draxler2011,
abstract = {Percy is a small software framework for perception experiments via the WWW. It is implemented entirely in dynamic HTML and makes use of the new multimedia tags available in HTML5, eliminating the need for browser plug-ins or external players to display media content. With Percy, perception experiments can be run on any platform supporting HTML5, including tablet computers, smartphones or game consoles and thus access new participant populations. Percy supports touch interfaces and measures reaction times. It stores its data in a relational database system on a server. This allows immediate access to the experiment data via standard database access APIs. The system has been used for a number of experiments in German, Castilian Spanish and English.

@article{Jadoul2018a,
abstract = {This paper introduces Parselmouth, an open-source Python library that facilitates access to core functionality of Praat in Python, in an efficient and programmer-friendly way. We introduce and motivate the package, and present simple usage examples. Specifically, we focus on applications in data visualisation, file manipulation, audio manipulation, statistical analysis, and integration of Parselmouth into a Python-based experimental design for automated, in-the-loop manipulation of acoustic data. Parselmouth is available at https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth.},

@misc{Charpentier1989,
abstract = {We review in a common framework several algorithms that have been proposed recently, in order to improve the voice quality of speech synthesis using diphones [1-3]. These algorithms are based on a pitch-synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA) approach for modifying the speech prosody and concatenating diphone waveforms. The modifications of the speech signal are performed either in the frequencydomain (FD-PSOLA), using the Fast Fourier Transform, or directly in the time domain (TD-P SOLA), depending on the length of the window used in the synthesis process. The frequency domain approach is capable or a great flexibility in modifying the spectral characteristics of the speech signal, while the time domain approach provides very efficient solutions for the real time implementation of synthesis systems. We also discuss the different kinds of distortions involved in thesedifferent algorithms.},
