abstract = {In past dichotic listening studies, linguistic stimuli have shown a right ear advantage, implying left hemisphere dominance for language processing, while other stimuli incorporating pitch distinctions have shown no ear perference or a left ear (right hemisphere) advantage. Ear preferences in tone language speakers were compared for 3 sets of stimuli: (a) pitch differences within language stimuli (tone-words in the tone language, Thai); (b) language stimuli without pitch differences (consonant-vowel words on mid-tone); and (c) pitch differences alone (hums). Results from 22 native Thai speakers demonstrate that tone-words and consonant-words are better heard at the right ear, while the hums show no ear effect. Preliminary results on 14 English-speaking Ss suggest that the consonant-words give the usual right ear effect, while the tone-words and the hums do not. It is concluded that pitch discrimination is lateralized to the left hemisphere when the pitch differences are linguistically processed. (47 ref.)},

@article{Ye2020,
abstract = {Pitch shifting is a common voice editing technique in which the original pitch of a digital voice is raised or lowered. It is likely to be abused by the malicious attacker to conceal his/her true identity. Existing forensic detection methods are no longer effective for weakly pitch-shifted voice. In this paper, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect not only strongly pitch-shifted voice but also weakly pitch-shifted voice of which the shifting factor is less than ±4 semitones. Specifically, linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) computed from power spectrums are considered and their dynamic coefficients are extracted as the discriminative features. And the CNN model is carefully designed with particular attention to the input feature map, the activation function and the network topology. We evaluated the algorithm on voices from two datasets with three pitch shifting software. Extensive results show that the algorithm achieves high detection rates for both binary and multiple classifications.},

@article{Traunmuller1994,
abstract = {Published data on the frequency of the voice fundamental (F0) in speech show its range of variation, often expressed in terms of two standard deviations (SD) of the F0-distribution, to be approximately the same for men and women if expressed in semitones, but the observed SD varies substantially between different investigations. Most of the differences can be attributed to the following factors: SD is increased in tone languages and it varies with the type of discourse. The more ‘lively' the type of discourse, the larger it is. The dependence of SD on the type of discourse tends to be mom pronounced in the speech of women than of men. Based on an analysis of various production data A is shown that speakers normally achieve an increased SD by increasing the excursions of F0 from a ‘base-value' that lies about 1.5 SD below their mean F0. This is relevant to applications in speech technology as well as to general theories of speech communication such as the ‘modulation theory' in which the base-value of F0 is seen as a carrier of frequency.},
