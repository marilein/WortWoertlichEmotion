abstract = {Prosodic Features of Spoken Utterances in Armenian. – Certain metrical patterns attested in native Armenian spoken utterances are usually labelled as unacceptable in adult standardized speech (ira cf. ir ‘his/her', incha? cf. inch? ‘what?', mezi cf. mez ‘us', etc.) or strange/unaccountable in child language (“Harik senak mət tse” (Tigran 1.2) cf. “Hairiki seniak ʧem mətel”-'I haven't entered daddy's study'). Unfortunately, authentic spoken utterances have not been seriously addressed in Armenian linguistic studies, though as compared to the so- called ‘literary' (standardized and to some extent artificial) speech, naturally spoken utterances often reveal crucial information about the structure of a language or language in general. The present analysis accounts for certain monosyllabic structures surfacing consistently as bisyllabic (C)V.C□′ by adding an obligatory nucleus constituent to the final onset - mez→me.zi ‘us', ir→i.ra ‘his/her'. This reality suggests that the occurrence of augmented units in surface representations is directly dependent on cer- tain phonological processes, those that secure Foot Binarity in prosodic structures to satisfy UG or/and language specific well-formedness conditions for metrical representa- tions.},
