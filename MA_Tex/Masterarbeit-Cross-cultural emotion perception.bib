abstract = {Certain signaling functions of the pitch of voice are remarkably similar across languages and cultures: (1) high or rising pitch to mark questions, low or falling pitch to mark nonquestions; (2) high pitch to signal politeness, low pitch to signal assertiveness; (3) in ‘sound symbolic' vocabulary, high tone used with words connoting smallness or diminutive, low tone with words connoting largeness. These patterns can be explained by the assumption that human vocal communication exploits the ‘frequency code', a cross-species association of high pitch vocalizations with smallness (of the vocalizer), lack of threat, and of low pitch vocalizations with the vocalizer's largeness and threatening intent. {\textcopyright} 1983 S.

abstract = {The author suggests that the following seemingly disparate phenomena have an underlying relationship: (a) cross-language similarities in the intonation contours for statements versus questions, (b) cross-cultural similarities in the vocal expression via intonation of attitude and affect, (c) cross-language patterns in the use of tone, vowels, and consonants in sound symbolic' vocabularly, (d) cross-species use of F0 in threatening or non threatening vocalizations, (e) cross-cultural and cross-species use of certain facial expressions (involving distinct mouth shape), and (f) the existence of sexual dimorphism in the vocal anatomy of humans (and certain non humans). He argues that all arise due to an innately specifiec 'frequency code', which associates high acoustic frequency with the primary meaning of 'small vocalizer' and thus such secondary meaning as 'subordinate, submissive, non threatening, desirous of the receiver's goodwill, etc.' and associates with low acoustic frequency the primary meaning of 'large vocalizer' and such secondary meanings as 'dominant, aggressive, threatening, etc.'},

abstract = {To investigate the impact of culture on emotion processing, we conducted a study comparing the intensity ratings of external expression (intensity level of speaker's vocal expression) and speaker's internal feeling (intensity level participants think the speaker is experiencing). Specifically, a group of Canadian and Chinese participants categorized emotions (anger, fear, happiness, and sadness) and judged the intensity of emotional utterances in three languages (Chinese, English, and Hindi). Both groups were more accurate at recognizing emotions in their native language. In contrast to related work on facial expressions, which concluded that Eastern participants were more likely to assume that speakers experienced more intense feelings than what they expressed, compared to Western participants, our study on vocal expressions did not find similar cultural effects. Both Canadian and Chinese participants rated the internal feelings of speakers as more intense than their external expressions of emotion. Differences between studies are discussed in terms of the unique structure and social functions of vocal and facial expressions in communication and their interactions with culture.},

@article{Abdel-Hamid2020,
abstract = {Speech emotion recognition (SER) research has usually focused on the analysis of the native language of speakers, most commonly, targeting European and Asian languages. In the present study, a bilingual Arabic/English speech emotion database elicited from 16 male and 16 female Egyptian participants was created in order to investigate how the linguistic and prosodic features were affected by the anger, fear, happiness and sadness emotions across Arabic and English emotional speech. The results of the linguistic analysis indicated that the participants preferred to express their emotions indirectly, mainly using religious references, and that the female participants tended to use language that was more tentative and emotionally expressive, while the male participants tended to use language that was more assertive and independent. As for the prosodic analysis, statistical t-tests showed that the prosodic features of pitch, intensity and speech rate were more indicative of anger and happiness while less relevant to fear and scarcely significant for sadness. Furthermore, speech emotion recognition performed using linear support vector machine (SVM) with AdaBoost also supported these results. In regard to first and second language linguistic features, there was no significant difference in the choice of words and structures expressing the different emotions in the two languages, but in terms of prosodic features, the females' speech showed higher pitch in Arabic in all cases while both genders showed close intensity values in the two languages and faster speech rate in Arabic than in English.},

@article{Chronaki2018,
abstract = {Humans have an innate set of emotions recognised universally. However, emotion recognition also depends on socio-cultural rules. Although adults recognise vocal emotions universally, they identify emotions more accurately in their native language. We examined developmental trajectories of universal vocal emotion recognition in children. Eighty native English speakers completed a vocal emotion recognition task in their native language (English) and foreign languages (Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic) expressing anger, happiness, sadness, fear, and neutrality. Emotion recognition was compared across 8-to-10, 11-to-13-year-olds, and adults. Measures of behavioural and emotional problems were also taken. Results showed that although emotion recognition was above chance for all languages, native English speaking children were more accurate in recognising vocal emotions in their native language. There was a larger improvement in recognising vocal emotion from the native language during adolescence. Vocal anger recognition did not improve with age for the non-native languages. This is the first study to demonstrate universality of vocal emotion recognition in children whilst supporting an "in-group advantage" for more accurate recognition in the native language. Findings highlight the role of experience in emotion recognition, have implications for child development in modern multicultural societies and address important theoretical questions about the nature of emotions.},

abstract = {One hundred and nineteen undergraduate students (62 men and 57 women) of Chinese origin at the National University of Singapore answered three self-report humor questionnaires. Students were also asked to supply their favorite joke (M. A. Johnson, 1991) and a description of a person with an outstanding sense of humor (M. Crawford and D. Gressley, 1991). These responses were compared with results obtained using the same questionnaires and methods in previous studies in Israel and the United States. In general, means and reliabilities of results obtained from the Singapore study replicated those found in other countries. However, Singaporean participants reported significantly less use of humor for coping. Content analysis of jokes supplied by Singaporean students reflected conservative values: Compared with American students, they reported a significantly greater number of jokes with aggressive content and relatively fewer jokes with sexual content. Contrary to expectations, very few gender differences were found. Regardless of gender, a majority of participants nominated a man as an example of a person with an outstanding sense of humor. {\textcopyright} 2001 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The finding that expressed emotion is associated with the course of psychiatric disorder has generated a great deal of clinical and research interest in expressed emotion as an important risk factor. Theoretical elucidation of the construct of expressed emotion has lagged considerably behind this interest, however. The authors contribute to a dialogue on what is inside the "black box'' called expressed emotion. They argue that cross-cultural research can provide an empirical basis for the theoretical grounding of expressed emotion factors. A comparative approach reveals that the construct of expressed emotion is essentially cultural in nature. The constellation of emotions, auitudes, and behaviors that are indexed by the expressed emotion method represent cross-culturally variable features of family response to an ill relative. Questions surrounding the cultural validity of the construct of expressed emotion, the qualitative dimensions of expressed emotion, and statistically significant cross-cultural variations in expressed emotion profiles are discussed. Finally, the authors provide an outline of diverse (cul-tural, psychobiological, social-ecological) features of expressed emotion. Anthropological analysis of expressed emotion reveals that although expressed emotion indexes a Pandora's box of diverse features, culture provides the context of variation through which these factors are most productively analyzed.},

abstract = {This article proposes to reconceptualize attachment theory as a culture-sensitive framework. First the seminal contribution of John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth are recognized in proposing a new paradigm for understanding children's development, synthesizing the interdisciplinary knowledge of relationship formation present during the 1950s (Bowlby) and developing a fieldwork approach in combination with quasi-experimental procedures in the laboratory (Ainsworth). It is argued that students of attachment theory have expanded the framework with respect to the intergenerational transmission and the organizational nature of attachment, relations with psychopathology and clinical applications, and its psychophysiological foundation. It is further argued that attachment theorists were not responsive to developments in evolutionary sciences and cultural/anthropological approaches of parenting and child development. From an evolutionary perspective, contextual variability is crucial to meet the purpose of adaptation. It is demonstrated that the assumptions of monotropy, the conception of stranger anxiety, as well as the definition of attachment in mainstream attachment research are in line with the conception of psychological autonomy, adaptive for Western middle-class, but deviate from the cultural values of many non-Western and mainly rural ecosocial environments. In the concluding paragraph, a strategy is proposed for an empirical research program that would contribute to the cultural foundation of attachment. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Two sets of vocal-emotional stimuli were presented to 35 German and 30 American listeners: (1) sentences in German spoken with five different vocal emotions; and (2) systematically rate- or pitch-altered versions of the original emotional stimuli. In addition to response frequencies on emotional categories, activity ratings were obtained. For the systematically altered stimuli, slow rate was reliably associated with the ‘‘sad'' label. In contrast, fast rate was classified as angry, frightened, or neutral. Manipulation of pitch variation was less potent than rate manipulation in influencing vocal emotional category choices. Reduced pitch variation was associated with perception as sad or neutral; greater pitch variation increased frightened, angry, and happy responses. Performance was highly similar for the two samples, although across tasks, German subjects per- ceived greater variability of activity in the emotional stimuli than did American participants.},

abstract = {The end-result of perceptual reorganization in infancy is currently viewed as a reconfigured perceptual space, "warped" around native-language phonetic categories, which then acts as a direct perceptual filter on any non-native sounds: na{\"{i}}ve-listener discrimination of non-native-sounds is determined by their mapping onto native-language phonetic categories that are acoustically/articulatorily most similar. We report results that suggest another factor in non-native speech perception: some perceptual sensitivities cannot be attributed to listeners' warped perceptual space alone, but rather to enhanced general sensitivity along phonetic dimensions that the listeners' native language employs to distinguish between categories. Specifically, we show that the knowledge of a language with short and long vowel categories leads to enhanced discrimination of non-native consonant length contrasts. We argue that these results support a view of perceptual reorganization as the consequence of learners' hierarchical inductive inferences about the structure of the language's sound system: infants not only acquire the specific phonetic category inventory, but also draw higher-order generalizations over the set of those categories, such as the overall informativity of phonetic dimensions for sound categorization. Non-native sound perception is then also determined by sensitivities that emerge from these generalizations, rather than only by mappings of non-native sounds onto native-language phonetic categories. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

It is concluded that culture-and language specific paralinguistic patterns may influence the decoding process. One of the key issues of current debate in the psychology of emotion concerns the universal-ity versus cultural relativity of emotional expression. This has important implications for the central question of the nature and function of emotion. Although there is a general consensus that both biological and cultural factors contribute to the emotion process (see Mesquita, Frijda, {\&} Scherer, 1997), the relative contribution of each of the factors, or the respective amount of variance explained, remains to be explored. An ideal way to study this issue empirically is to compare outward manifestations of emotional reactions with similar appraisals of eliciting situations in different cultures (see Scherer, 1997). Such studies could reveal the extent to which similar expression configurations indicate comparable evaluation and reaction tendencies. Unfortunately, given the difficulty of identifying and systematically studying comparable eliciting situations in different cultures, such studies have yet to be conducted. Instead, researchers in this area have adopted an indirect approach in addressing the issue. This approach is based on the assumption that, given the indisputable role of emotional expression in social communication, the ability of members of one culture to correctly 76 AUTHORS' NOTE: This research has been conducted as a collaborative research program in the context of the Coordination Europ{\'{e}}enne de la Recherche sur les Emotions (CERE), which is formed by the laboratories directed by Matty Chiva,},

abstract = {This article presents an overview of the Schwartz theory of basic human values. It discusses the nature of values and spells out the features that are common to all values and what distinguishes one value from another. The theory identifies ten basic personal values that are recognized across cultures and explains where they come from. At the heart of the theory is the idea that values form a circular structure that reflects the motivations each value expresses. This circular structure, that captures the conflicts and compatibility among the ten values is apparently culturally universal. The article elucidates the psychological principles that give rise to it. Next, it presents the two major methods developed to measure the basic values, the Schwartz Value Survey and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Findings from 82 countries, based on these and other methods, provide evidence for the validity of the theory across cultures. The findings reveal substantial differences in the value priorities of individuals. Surprisingly, however, the average value priorities of most societal groups exhibit a similar hierarchical order whose existence the article explains. The last section of the article clarifies how values differ from other concepts used to explain behavior—attitudes, beliefs, norms, and traits.},
